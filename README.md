Hi Dr.Gomes,

Here is our mini Project for ME296. We made a CFTOC Simulation for
Parallel parking of the a Car. This is a very cool project, and it is fairly large. Thus, this readme file can help a lot for navigation through the Project:

File system:

	Code: All the code implementations, and the main function contians in the file me296proj.m

	Report: The Written Report of the project. The FinalReport.pdf gives the best form to read although 3 file contains the same contents.

	Data: Data generated for ploting Reachibility set. Because the run time of the code is too high. We use a seperate file to store the data. 

	Image: The Images of the Results generated from the the main file.

	Video: The Vedios saved for better observation. 

Changes made after discussing with you Last Week:

	1. Adding the Reachibility Analysis to the Report.

	2. Fixed the problem of wheel inertia constrains. We convert the comfort constrains into a moment of inertia input constrains. 

	3. Fixed some bug of cost function, and making the result more optimum.
